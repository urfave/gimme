# These are versions which are passed to runtests, on each architecture, for CI
# testing. These do not need to be authoritative.
#
# Listing all versions ever provides for quadratic test runtime as we expand
# architectures and OSes. So we no longer do that.
#
# Instead we include the highest patch release from each of the two supported
# minor versions plus the highest patch release from the three most recent
# unsupported minor versions.
